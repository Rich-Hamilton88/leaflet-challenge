# Visualizing Data with JavaScript Leaflet library

Visited the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and picked a data set to visualize via an API key. 
Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
Objective of this project was to display the ability to use the JavaScript library Leaflet and create an HTML document to display the results.
